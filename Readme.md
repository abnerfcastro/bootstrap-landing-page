# web-boilerplate

This is my personal boilerplate repository to start new projects quickly.

### Languages/frameworks used:

* NodeJS
* Express
* Angular 1.6.2
* Bootstrap

It comes with an Angular module set up (named `project`, rename if you like) and a `MainController` to get started.

To get it up and running, just type

```
npm start
```
